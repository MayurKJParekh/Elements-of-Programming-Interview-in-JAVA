    Looking carefully at the brute-force algorithm, observe that it does not take adÂ¬
vantage of the information present in the node. For example, if k is greater than the
number of nodesin the left subtree, the kth node cannot lie in the left subtree. More
precisely, if the left subtree has L nodes, then the kth node in the original tree is the
(k -L)th node when we skip the left subtree. Conversely, if k < L, the desired node
lies in the left subtree. For example, the left subtree in Figure 10.1 on Page 150 has
seven nodes,so the tenth node cannot in the left subtree. Instead it is the third node
if we skip the leftsubtree. This observation leads to the following program.

    Since we descend the tree in each iteration, the time complexity is0(h),where h isthe
height of the tree.
